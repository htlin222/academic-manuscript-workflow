# Advances in Breast Cancer Treatment: A Contemporary Review

## Abstract

This review summarizes recent advances in breast cancer treatment, including novel therapeutic approaches and clinical trial findings. We examine current trends in surgical techniques, systemic therapies, and precision medicine applications in breast cancer care.

## Introduction

Breast cancer remains one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide [@Bray2024]. The landscape of breast cancer treatment has evolved significantly over the past decade, with personalized medicine approaches revolutionizing patient outcomes.

## Current Treatment Modalities

### Surgery

Surgical intervention continues to be a cornerstone of breast cancer treatment. Recent advances in surgical techniques have shifted towards breast-conserving therapy when oncologically appropriate. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has largely replaced axillary lymph node dissection for staging in early-stage disease [@ASCO2024].

### Systemic Therapy

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has gained prominence, particularly for triple-negative and HER2-positive breast cancers. The addition of platinum-based regimens has shown improved pathological complete response rates in triple-negative breast cancer patients [@Loibl2023].

The development of HER2-targeted therapies has dramatically improved outcomes for HER2-positive breast cancer. Dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, combined with chemotherapy, has become the standard of care in both neoadjuvant and metastatic settings [@PEONY2024].

### Immunotherapy

The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors has opened new therapeutic avenues, particularly for triple-negative breast cancer. Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy has shown survival benefits in both early and advanced disease settings [@Schmid2024].

## Future Directions

Ongoing research focuses on identifying novel therapeutic targets, developing more effective immunotherapy combinations, and overcoming resistance mechanisms. The integration of artificial intelligence in treatment planning and response prediction represents a promising frontier.

## Conclusions

The treatment of breast cancer has become increasingly personalized, with therapeutic decisions guided by tumor biology, genomic profiles, and individual patient factors. This multidisciplinary approach has led to improved survival rates and quality of life for breast cancer patients.
