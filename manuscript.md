Mastectomy is standard care for more than one third of patients with stage I and stage II breast cancer [@AmericanCancerSociety2024]. Stage II disease involves tumors no more than 5 cm in diameter with metastases in one to three axillary lymph nodes (N1) or tumors of at least 2 cm without nodal metastases (stages T1N1M0, T2N1M0, T2N0M0, and T3N0M0 in the TNM [tumor size, node involvement, and metastasis] system; tumor size: T1, ≤2 cm; T2, >2 cm to 5 cm; or T3, >5 cm). Patients with stage II breast cancer who have N1 disease or who have N0 (node-negative) disease but with poor histologic features (including larger tumor size, a histologic grade of 3, or lymphovascular invasion) are considered to be at intermediate risk for recurrence.
Landmark Danish and Canadian randomized, controlled trials reported in 1997 and 1999 showed that postmastectomy radiotherapy for stages II and III reduced the risk of locoregional recurrence and improved 10-year survival among women with nodal metastases [@Overgaard1997; @Overgaard1999; @Ragaz1997]. A 2014 meta-analysis of trials of postmastectomy radiotherapy by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) [@EBCTCG2014], which included data from the Danish and Canadian trials, showed that among patients with disease classified pathologically as N1 (pN1), the cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence as a first event at 10 years was 16.5 percentage points lower with postmastectomy radiotherapy than with no postmastectomy radiotherapy and 20-year survival was 7.9 percentage points higher. The adjuvant systemic therapy used in these trials is now considered to be suboptimal [@Bonadonna2005; @Goldhirsch2013].
Major improvements in systemic therapy and reductions in breast cancer mortality [@DeSantis2022] have challenged the applicability of the evidence base for postmastectomy radiotherapy in current practice. Hence, the role of postmastectomy radiotherapy in patients with involvement of one to three axillary nodes is uncertain, and this uncertainty is reflected in differing guidelines [@NCCN2024; @ASCO2025; @ESMO2023] and practices [@Jagsi2016; @Wright2016]. Evaluation of postmastectomy radiotherapy in patients with one to three involved nodes became a research priority of the National Institutes of Health in 2000 [@NIH2001]. Patients with pN0 disease who have other factors associated with intermediate risk might also benefit from postmastectomy radiotherapy.
Most locoregional recurrences occur on the chest wall [@Kyndi2008; @Gujral2020], so this area is considered to be a critical target for postmastectomy radiotherapy. Here, we report the 10-year results of the Medical Research Council–European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Breast International Group (BIG) 2-04 SUPREMO (Selective Use of Postoperative Radiotherapy after Mastectomy) trial, which present a more contemporary picture of the effect on overall survival of postmastectomy radiotherapy selectively delivered to the chest wall.
